#Methodology
1. Data collection
collecting dataset of 6500 apps from Kaggle and fraud apps from various articles.

2. Data pre-processing and filtration 
remove missing value, only required columns are kept. This is done through pandas

3. Model creation and training
In the model we have taken 75% of the data for training and rest 25% for testing
We have Made model of decision tree, naive bayes algorithm and logistics regression. Further after comparing all the models, since the accuracy of decision tree was highest, so we picked it's model.

4. Deploying of model
Made user interface web page using flask. In which the user puts the url in the search box and gets the result as "fake" or "safe to use" for the app.
